\subsection{Questions}
\label{Method_Questions}

To gather results, we decided to use the "observer and interview" method. We would observe the player's decisions in the game, and, when the player was done with the game, ask them questions we felt were relevant. We made our questions as neutral as we could, to make the player think about their answer, instead of giving us a simple "yes/no".

Below is a list of the questions along with our reasoning behind asking them:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textit{"Why did you take the path you took?"} \\
 		This question would give us a clear idea of why the player made the decisions they made. Was it because of the reward the narrator talked about, was it just on impulse or was it to try to trick the narrator? \\

	\item \textit{"What did you think about the narrator?"} \\
		 This question would tell us how the player experienced the narrator. Was he useful or not, was he reliable or not, etc.? \\

	\item \textit{"Did you have any desire to do what the narrators said?"} \\
		 This question would tell us whether the player wanted to listen to the narrator or not. TODO: Fix. Lyder dumt, men kan ikke komme p√• noget godt. \\

	\item \textit{"Would you do anything differently if you were to play again?"} \\
		 This question shows if the narrator had any influence on the player. If the player did not want to do anything differently (maybe because they felt they had taken the best route), it shows that the narrator had a lot of influence. \\

	\item \textit{"What did you think about the different rooms you went through?"} \\
		 This question was for figuring if the player had even thought about the rooms or not, and if yes whether the rooms had any influence on the decisions of the player or not. \\

	\item \textit{"What influence did you feel the choices you made had on the outcome?"} \\
		 This question would give us an idea about whether the player felt that the narrator had been unreliable or not through the rooms. If the player felt their choices had no influence, we could deduce that the narrator had felt unreliable. \\

\end{itemize}

We chose to not have more questions, as we felt these were enough to gather the information we were interested in. More questions might have yielded more information, but it would have been redundant as it would either cover what these questions cover, or be of no interest with regards to our research questions.
