The definition of what makes a narrator unreliable is a highly contested point. In her essay on fallible and untrustworthy narrators, Greta Olson first analyses Wayne Booth's introduction of the term unreliable and Ansgar N\"unning's criticism of Booth's definition. In addition, she offers an amplification of Booth's model of unreliability\cite{Olson}.
