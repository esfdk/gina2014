The definition of what makes a narrator unreliable is a highly contested point. In her essay on fallible and untrustworthy narrators, Greta Olson first analyses Wayne Booth's introduction of the term unreliable and Ansgar N\"unning's criticism of Booth's definition. In addition, she offers an amplification of Booth's model of unreliability\cite{Olson}. This work is strongly related to ours because we are interested in what effect that the unreliability of a narrator has on the decisions that the players make.

Porteous et al. \cite{Porteous} analysis of the influence that the point of view of the characters have on the narrative is interesting. The decision making of players could possibly be heavily influenced by which characters point of view the player is experiencing. In the game we made and tested for this paper, the narrator's influence on the player is heavily dependent on whether the player cares about what happens to the character they are playing. If they instead had the point of view of the narrator, they would know that the narrator is lying and such they would likely make different choices (or not care at all).
