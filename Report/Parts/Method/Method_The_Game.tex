\subsection{The test game}
\label{Method_Game}

The game we created requires the player to go through four rooms, each room presenting the player with a choice between two doors; one on the right side of the room and one on the left side of the room. After the four rooms, the player ends in a final room with no exits and the game is over. The structure of the rooms can be seen in figure \ref{fig:RoomStructure} on page \pageref{fig:RoomStructure}.

The first four rooms the player goes through are identical, with an entrance and two exits. The room is square and the walls are grey (see figure \ref{fig:Screenshot_FirstRoom} on page \pageref{fig:Screenshot_FirstRoom} for a picture). There are no objects in the rooms, as we only wanted the narrator to be influencing the player's decision. Had we placed anything else in the rooms, the players might have gotten distracted by it and not paid attention to the narrator.

The last room is different from the others, as it is the last room. This room has the same dimensions and color as the other rooms, but there are no exits, only an entrance. In addition, there is a pile of coins in the middle of the room that represents the player's reward. Attempting to pick the coins up will end the game.

What the player is never told during the test, is that the first four rooms not only look alike, the are the exact same room. When the player choses an exit, the game records which side they chose and then sends them back to the entrance of the room. This repeats four times, after which the player is let into the final room with the reward. We decided to use this "one-room-fits-all" method, as there was no need to create fifteen different versions of the exact same room.

While we reuse the same room multiple times, we chose to only have the player go through the room a few times. There were two reasons for this:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We did not want the player to become bored with walking through rooms, so we kept it to a low number. Adding more rooms would increase the likelihood that the player chose a door just for the sake of doing something different, thereby removing the point of having the narrator affect them.
	\item For every "layer" of rooms, the amount of rooms would be doubled. As we wanted unique script for every possible left/right-combination the player could take, we would need to create more than twice as much audio as we already had for every new layer added. This is a huge resource-cost and one we felt was not worth what little extra benefit we would gain.
\end{enumerate}

As we wanted a narrator to (attempt to) influence the player, we have him speak to the player every time they enter a room. In each room the narrator gives a hint to which door is the better choice, either saying that one would result in a better reward or saying that the other door would decrease the reward. This is part of trying to make the narrator influence the player's decision. 

The way the narrator talks to the player, implies that what the player is experiencing was something that happened in the past (\textit{"Taking the door on the right out of this room would grant him a much higher reward than taking the left door, but he had no way of knowing this."}).

What the narrator says specifically in each room, and how he reacts, depends on the route the player has chosen. This way, we avoid that some of the script may sound out of place because the player went an unexpected way.

The only room where the script does not change based on the route is the last room. We chose to do this, to give the player the feeling that the route they chose did not actually matter, as it actually did not matter. The reward is always the same, no matter what way the player chooses.

As the reward is always the same, no matter the route, it is clear that our narrator is unreliable, as he repeatedly tells the player that taking one path would be more beneficial to the player than taking the other. As the narrator in our game is aware that the reward will remain the same, he is not misinformed nor mistaken - he is lying and as so would be defined as an untrustworthy narrator using the amplified model suggested by Olson.

We decided to make the narrator unreliable because we wanted to see if the player could figure out that the narrator was lying, while only giving one, weak hit to that fact.
