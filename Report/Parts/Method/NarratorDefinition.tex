\subsection{Unreliable Narrators}
Abbot defines a narrator as "One who tells a story." \cite[p. 238]{Abbot}. A narrator is not the same as the author of a work. Instead the author of the work uses the narrator as a device to present the narrative. Many works use a single unidentified\footnote{Unidentified as in the narrator being unknown to the reader, which may make narratee confuse author and narrator.} narrator, often in combination with third-person narration.
