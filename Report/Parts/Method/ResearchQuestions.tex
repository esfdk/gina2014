\subsection{Research questions}
In this paper, we attempt to answer two different research questions.

Research question 1:
\begin{center}
\textit{"What influence does the narrator have on decision making in games?"}
\end{center}
Our interest in this question is to learn whether people simply do what the narrator says, if they actively oppose what the narrator is saying or if they ignore the narrator.

Research question 2:
\begin{center}
\textit{"Does the player experience an unreliable narrator as reliable if no contradictions are given in the narrative?"}
\end{center}

In order for us to answer our research questions, we made a very short game in Unity with simple assets and mechanics. We had people playtest the game and ask them questions pertaining to our research questions.
