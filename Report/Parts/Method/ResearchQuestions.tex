\subsection{Research questions}
\label{Method_Research}

In this paper, we attempt to answer two different research questions.\\

Research question 1:
\begin{center}
\textit{"What influence does the narrator have on decision making in games?"}
\end{center}
Both of us have played a lot of games with a lot of narrative, but most of those games have told a story without focusing on trying to influence the player. In addition to that, we could not find a lot of information on this subject.

Because of this, we want to learn whether people simply do what the narrator says, if they actively oppose what the narrator is saying or if they ignore the narrator. \\

Research question 2:
\begin{center}
\textit{"Does the player experience an unreliable narrator as reliable if no contradictions are given in the narrative?"}
\end{center}
Our interest in this question arose when we read Greta Olson's "Reconsidering Unreliability: Fallible and Untrustworthy Narrators"\cite{Olson}, in which it is said that an unreliable narrator can only be identified as unreliable if the reader is given information that contradicts what the narrator is saying. 

With the game we wanted to make to answer question 1 - one player, one narrator and nothing else - we wanted to figure out if the players even figure out if our narrator is unreliable or not.\\

In order for us to answer these two questions, we decided to make a very short game in Unity with simple assets and mechanics. We had people playtest the game and ask them questions pertaining to our research questions.
