This report has been written as part of a project in the Interactive Narrative course on the Master of Games at the IT-University of Copenhagen.\\

What effect does a narrator having on player choice in games? In this report, we will attempt to answer this question by reviewing the different definitions of a narrator presented by Mieke Bal and H. Porter Abbot and the different definitions by Wayne Booth, Ansgar N\"unning and Greta Olson of what makes a narrator unreliable in regards to the narrative that is being related. We will use the different definitions to define our use of the concept of an unreliable narrator and then address what effect they can have in a narrative (interactive or otherwise).

After determining what an unreliable narrator is, we will discuss the motivation behind the research questions presented in this report: What influence, if any, a narrator has on a player's decision-making in games and if a player can determine if a narrator is unreliable, given that there is only the player and the narrator. 

Next, we will discuss the method we used to gather the data we use to conclude on our research questions - a simple game made to test the influence that a narrator has on the player. We will discuss the thought process behind the concept of the game and the design choices we made in terms of length and variance in the game. In addition, we will explain the gameplay, the structure of the game, how the narrator acts in the game and why we chose the game length that we did. Then we will list the questions that we asked the players that tested our game and the motivation behind them.

Finally, we discuss the results of testing the game TODO: Get results and talk about them here..
