\label{Introduction}

This report has been written as part of a project in the Interactive Narrative course on the Master line of Games at the IT-University of Copenhagen.

%In this report, we will look at whether a narrator in a game can influence the player's decision-making and, if yes, to what degree. We will also look at whether the player can determine if a narrator is unreliable, assuming that only the player and the narrator are in the game.

In this report, we will initially look at related work on unreliable narrators in general, both reliable and unreliable. We will use this information to give our view of what an unreliable narrator is and how narratives can influence a player.

We will then present our our research questions along with why we want to look into them and what we hope to learn from them. This is followed by what method we will use to gather information to answer the questions. An analysis of the results come after the method, in which we will see if the results are what we expected them to be, or how far they deviated.

Based on this, we will conclude whether we answered the questions to a satisfying degree and what could be done to improve on the project overall.
