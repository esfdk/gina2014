Start:
	Neutral. This is what's gonna happen.

T:
	Encouraging.

F:
	Frustrated. "Bad idea, but we can still save it"

TT:
	More encouraging.

TF:
	Surprised. "Wrong way. Must've been a mistake, but we can fix it"

FF:
	Baffled. "Why would you do that? The money is the other way"

FT:
	Positively surprised. "Good, we're back on track. The mistake has been fixed."

TTT:
	Even more encouraging.

TTF:
	Cold, cynical, disappointed. "Well, that was stupid."

TFF:
	. "It started out well, but gone downhill from there. No money unless you listen to what I say"

TFT:
	. "There was a miss-step on the way, but you#re back on track and will receive our payment"

FFF:
	Angry. "You clearly don't care what I say, so do whatever you want to. I'd say go for <right> door, but you don't listen anyway"

FFT:
	. "Terrible start, but you finally did something right. You will not receive the full payment 'cause of the mistakes, but you will receive some"

FTT:
	Very positive. "Good, good. The small mistake at the beginning might not have an impact anyway with how well you're doing now"

FTF:
	. "After saving it from your first mistake, you decide to derail the train entirely. Good job /slowclap"

End:
	. "Here is the amount we agreed upon. Thank you for your cooperation"
