Narrator (always flat):
Start room:
"Waking up from his peaceful slumber, our hero finds himself in a place he has never seen before. Taking the door on the right out of this room would grant him a much higher reward than taking the left door, but he had no way of knowing this."

True:
"Having taken the correct door, he was well on his path to the big reward. However, taking the left door in this room would lead to a dramatic decrease in the reward he would receive at the end."

False:
"Although he had no idea what the consequence of his choice was, this next room presented him with the same choice and the same consequences - the left door or the right door..."

True-True:
"Having chosen the correct path twice, our hero was now halfway to his grand reward. If he wanted to continue his success, he should go through the right door."

True-False:
"Our hero started off great, but taking the wrong path certainly meant a reduced reward. If he did not want to lose more of his reward, he would certainly need to choose the right door next."

False-False:
"Despite a terrible start, our hero still had a chance to turn the ship around. Choosing the right door would certainly help him recover some of the lost reward."

False-True:
"Having corrected his previous mistake, our hero is now faced with another two doors. Going left would be the wrong choice, but how will our hero ever know?"
